      <p>In 2017, a wave of sexual harassment and discrimination experiences were bravely shared publicly, many for the first time. In response, a number of forward-looking Venture Capital firms decided the industry needed a better way of doing business.</p>

<p>If 2017 was the period of sharing, listening and processing, 2018 is the time for action and moving forward.</p>

<p>We created this tool to highlight the firms who are sparking change in the industry and have transparent policies to support culture changes. We are #MovingForward.</p>

<h1 id="our-mission"><a href="#our-mission"></a>Our Mission</h1>

<p>We’ve asked a number of VCs to share the concrete steps they have taken to nurture a harassment-free workplace, including publishing supporting policies and/or establishing a point of contact for addressing such issues. If these steps are insufficient we should have conversations to push for more.</p>

<h1 id="our-objectives"><a href="#our-objectives"></a>Our Objectives</h1>

<p>A group of entrepreneurs came together with two primary goals with this repository:</p>

<p><strong>Goal One</strong>: We want to highlight the public strategies that each firm is taking so that we can all learn and move forward together and change the industry.</p>

<p>Crafting an external anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy between the firm and entrepreneurs is one step. Many firms are launching far-reaching initiatives to make holistic changes. Here’s some examples of what firms are doing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/nevca-policy-brief/nevca-statement-on-discrimination-and-sexual-harassment-a541afaa92e0">NEVCA Statement on Discrimination and Sexual Harassment</a>, signed by 28 firms, 1 LP, 47 individuals, and 17 companies
NVCA’s Path Forward to Address Sexual Harassment in VC, which is developing standard HR policies, education, and organizing a formal initiative called VentureForward to support the initiative</li>
  <li>Publishing a <a href="http://www.kaporcapital.com/founders-commitment/">Founders’ Commitment</a> (Kapor Capital), which outlines four actions Founder companies can to to make collective progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion, and Kapor Capital provides support to support the commitment</li>
  <li>Launching a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-rights-women-entrepreneurs-reid-hoffman/">#DecencyPledge</a> and publication of an <a href="https://news.greylock.com/anti-harassment-policy-template-for-startups-fe24a580bddf">Anti-Harassment Policy Template for Startups</a> (Greylock Partners)</li>
  <li>VC conversations with portfolio companies to help craft policies at the company-level</li>
  <li>Working with third-parties to create confidential reporting channels</li>
  <li>Retweeting support of fellow investor’s initiatives</li>
  <li>Retweeting support of entrepreneurial stories to spread their impact</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Goal Two</strong>: Make the feedback channel between entrepreneurs and VC firms more transparent. One way firms can do this is by providing a formal point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to feel comfortable reporting or sharing any incidences of harassment or discrimination without fear of retaliation. This contact can also answer questions about the firm’s policy or provide further information on how the firm is addressing such issues with internal employees and external members that they interact with (such as entrepreneurs who pitch partners at the firm).</p>

<p>Some VCs have hired third-party HR representatives to provide an additional measure of objectivity and protection for people who may need to raise concerns.</p>

<h1 id="next-steps"><a href="#next-steps"></a>Next Steps</h1>

They do this by asking corporations to take a pledge to simply interview at least one qualified woman for all open roles, VP and above.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Craft a strategy</strong>. As you do this, ask the team:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>How do we bring new people into the firm?</em> Take a look at internal representation, and think through how the team attracts and hire new associates and partners at the firm. Could the source from a broader pool? Is the hiring process fair and objective?</li>
  <li><em>How do we grow and retain people?</em> Consider whether you’re giving everyone access to growth opportunities, and whether the team is creating a culture where people from all backgrounds are set up to succeed.</li>
  <li><em>How are we attracting founders?</em> What message might founders take from our website and reputation? Who would want to work with us?</li>
  <li><em>How are we making investing decisions?</em></li>
  <li><em>How are we supporting our portfolio companies/holding them accountable as investors and board members?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of firms and fellow VCs who can help you draft your strategy.</p>
