      <p>In 2017, a wave of sexual harassment and discrimination experiences were bravely shared publicly, many for the first time. In response, a number of forward-looking Venture Capital firms decided the industry needed a better way of doing business.</p>

<p>2017 was a period of sharing, listening and processing. 2018 is the time for action and moving forward.</p>

<h1 id="our-mission"><a href="#our-mission"></a>Our Mission</h1>

<p>Our mission is to highlight the steps VCs have taken to nurture a diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free workplace and provide entrepreneurs with a point-of-contact for reporting issues and raising questions going forward. This will occur in three phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Starting the conversation.</strong> The VCs in this wiki are publicly establishing their commitment to progress by sharing their current-day policies, issuing their statements, and providing a point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to report issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Building, testing, and adapting.</strong> We value progress, not perfection. The first version is rarely the best. VCs, entrepreneurs, and the community will work together to evaluate these policies to highlight firms who are going above-and-above and identify areas for improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bringing the community together.</strong> We will share our learnings and engage our broader community in forward progress (e.g., later in Summer 2018 we are planning on adding LPs to this effort).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This wiki is a self-managed GitHub repository to which any firm can add their policies. And it is our hope that every major player in the venture ecosystem will add theirs as well.</p>

<p>=&gt; <em>If you’re a venture firm,</em> fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Bh5nZZbjiet5CJV23">our Google Survey</a> or <a href="https://github.com/WeAreMovingForward/wearemovingforward.github.io/compare?expand=1">submit a pull request</a> to share your efforts to nurture a diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free workplace.</p>

<p>=&gt; <em>If you’re an entrepreneur</em> and you don’t see your investor on this list, share this project with them.</p>

<h1 id="why-are-we-doing-this"><a href="#why-are-we-doing-this"></a>Why are we doing this?</h1>

<p>A small group of entrepreneurs came together with three goals for this project.</p>

<p><strong>1. Launch a public, collective step forward for the venture industry.</strong> We aim to highlight the public strategies each firm is committing to so that we can learn and move together. 
Crafting an external anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy between the firm and entrepreneurs is just a first step. There’s much more do to, and many organizations are launching far-reaching initiatives to make holistic changes. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/nevca-policy-brief/nevca-statement-on-discrimination-and-sexual-harassment-a541afaa92e0">NEVCA Statement on Discrimination and Sexual Harassment</a>, signed by 28 firms, 1 LP, 47 individuals, and 17 companies</li>
  <li>NVCA’s Path Forward to Address Sexual Harassment in VC, which is developing standard HR policies, education, and organizing a formal initiative called VentureForward to support the initiative</li>
  <li>Publishing a <a href="http://www.kaporcapital.com/founders-commitment/">Founders’ Commitment</a> (Kapor Capital), which outlines four actions Founder companies can to to make collective progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion, and Kapor Capital provides support to support the commitment</li>
  <li>Launching a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-rights-women-entrepreneurs-reid-hoffman/">#DecencyPledge</a> and publication of an <a href="https://news.greylock.com/anti-harassment-policy-template-for-startups-fe24a580bddf">Anti-Harassment Policy Template for Startups</a> (Greylock Partners)</li>
  <li>VC conversations with portfolio companies to help craft policies at the company-level</li>
  <li>Working with third-parties to create confidential reporting channels</li>
  <li>Retweeting support of fellow investor’s initiatives</li>
  <li>Retweeting support of entrepreneurial stories to spread their impact</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Facilitate transparent reporting channels and information routes.</strong> Entrepreneurs facing harassment or discrimination are often unsure where to go to report, causing them to feel like there is no choice except to go public.</p>

<p>One way firms can address this need is by providing a formal point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to feel comfortable sharing incidences of harassment or discrimination. Some VCs are working with third-party organizations that provide HR consulting on templates/policies or reporting channels for people who may need to raise concerns.</p>

<p>We’re also in favor of having an internal point-of-contact contact who can answer questions about the firm’s policy or provide further information on the firm’s diversity, inclusion, and anti-harassment policies.</p>

<p><strong>3. Provide a universal, open-source, and evolving wiki for continuous updates.</strong> As policies and supporting strategies evolve and the industry continues to iterate, we want to provide an open forum for any firm to self-report their efforts. We’ve hosting <a href="https://github.com/WeAreMovingForward/wearemovingforward.github.io">this directory on GitHub</a>.</p>
