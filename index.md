In 2017, a wave of sexual harassment and discrimination experiences were bravely shared publicly, many for the first time. In response, a number of forward-looking Venture Capital firms decided the industry needed a better way of doing business.

2017 was a period of sharing, listening and processing. 2018 is the time for action and moving forward.

# [](#our-mission)Our Mission

Our mission is to highlight the steps VCs have taken to nurture a diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free workplace and provide entrepreneurs with a point-of-contact for reporting issues and raising questions going forward. This will occur in three phases:

1. **Starting the conversation.** VCs in this wiki are publicly establishing their commitment to progress by sharing their current-day policies, issuing their statements, and providing a point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to report issues.

2. **Building, testing, and adapting.** We value progress, not perfection. The first version is rarely the best. VCs, entrepreneurs, and the community will work together to evaluate these policies to highlight firms who are going above-and-above and identify areas for improvement.

3. **Bringing the community together.** We will share our learnings and engage our broader community in forward progress (e.g., later in Summer 2018 we are planning on adding LPs to this effort).

This wiki is a self-managed GitHub repository to which any firm can add their policies. And it is our hope that every major player in the venture ecosystem will add theirs as well.

# [](#why-are-we-doing-this)Why are we doing this?

A small group of entrepreneurs came together with three goals for this project.

**1. Launch a public, collective step forward for the venture industry.** We aim to highlight the public strategies each firm is committing to so that we can learn and move together.
Crafting an external anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy between the firm and entrepreneurs is just a first step. There’s much more do to, and many organizations are launching far-reaching initiatives to make holistic changes. For example:


* [NEVCA Statement on Discrimination and Sexual Harassment](https://medium.com/nevca-policy-brief/nevca-statement-on-discrimination-and-sexual-harassment-a541afaa92e0), signed by 28 firms, 1 LP, 47 individuals, and 17 companies
* NVCA’s Path Forward to Address Sexual Harassment in VC, which is developing standard HR policies, education, and organizing a formal initiative called VentureForward to support the initiative
* Publishing a [Founders’ Commitment](http://www.kaporcapital.com/founders-commitment/) (Kapor Capital), which outlines four actions Founder companies can to to make collective progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion, and Kapor Capital provides support to support the commitment
* Launching a [#DecencyPledge](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-rights-women-entrepreneurs-reid-hoffman/) and publication of an [Anti-Harassment Policy Template for Startups](https://news.greylock.com/anti-harassment-policy-template-for-startups-fe24a580bddf) (Greylock Partners)
* VC conversations with portfolio companies to help craft policies at the company-level
* Working with third-parties to create confidential reporting channels
* Retweeting support of fellow investor’s initiatives
* Retweeting support of entrepreneurial stories to spread their impact

**2. Facilitate transparent reporting channels and information routes.** Entrepreneurs facing harassment or discrimination are often unsure where to go to report, causing them to feel like there is no choice except to go public.

One way firms can address this need is by providing a formal point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to feel comfortable sharing incidences of harassment or discrimination. Some VCs are working with third-party organizations that provide HR consulting on templates/policies or reporting channels for people who may need to raise concerns.

We’re also in favor of having an internal point-of-contact contact who can answer questions about the firm’s policy or provide further information on the firm’s diversity, inclusion, and anti-harassment policies.

**3. Provide a universal, open-source, and evolving wiki for continuous updates.** As policies and supporting strategies evolve and the industry continues to iterate, we want to provide an open forum for any firm to self-report their efforts.
