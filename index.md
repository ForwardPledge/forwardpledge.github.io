# [](#inspiration) What inspired this project?

At a dinner for entrepreneurs one evening, one of the founders asked: _“If I experienced harassment or discrimination, how would I know if it’s worth addressing? Where would I report it and how can I be protected against retaliation?”_

Over the following months, we asked our friends in VC if they had external anti-harassment/ discrimination policies and a reporting channel, and we discovered that many did not. 

During our conversations, we also discovered that although this issue was top of mind for VCs, it was hard to find out what individual firms were doing. We created #MovingForward to set a baseline, to spark conversations within VC firms, and to learn from one another. 

VCs in this wiki are publicly establishing their commitment to progress by sharing their current-day anti-harassment/discrimination policies, issuing a 100-word statement on how they moving forward in the wake of #MeToo, and providing a point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to report harassment and discrimination issues.

# [](#motivation) What's in it for you?
* _Value for Firms_: We’ve heard from VCs that the process of writing up external HR policies and a statement in the wake of #MeToo has sparked thoughtful conversations, codified ideas, and aligned the partnership. This wiki can serve as an inspiration to firms striving to nurture diverse, inclusive and harassment-free workplaces. 
* _Value for Founders_: Over time, we strive to build this into a resource where you can review policies, find initiatives that support you, and a reporting contact. 

This wiki is a self-managed GitHub repository to which any firm can add and update their policies, initiatives, and reporting lines. **And it is our hope that every major player in the venture ecosystem will add theirs as well.**

This wiki is a living document, and we value progress, not perfection

# [](#why-are-we-doing-this)But really, why are you doing this?


A small group of entrepreneurs came together with three goals for this project.

**1. Launch a public, collective step forward for the venture industry.** We aim to highlight the public strategies each firm is committing to so that we can learn and move together.
Crafting an external anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy between the firm and entrepreneurs is just a first step. There’s much more do to, and many organizations are launching far-reaching initiatives to make holistic changes. 

**2. Facilitate transparent reporting channels and information routes.** Entrepreneurs facing harassment or discrimination are often unsure where to go to report, causing them to feel like there is no choice except to go public. We face a large issue of under-reporting of issues in our community, because founders don’t know where to go.

One way firms can address this need is by providing a formal point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to feel comfortable sharing incidences of harassment or discrimination. Some VCs are working with third-party organizations that provide HR consulting on templates/policies or reporting channels for people who may need to raise concerns.

We’re also in favor of having an internal point-of-contact contact who can answer questions about the firm’s policy or provide further information on the firm’s diversity, inclusion, and anti-harassment policies.

**3. Provide a universal, open-source, and evolving wiki for continuous updates.** As policies and supporting strategies evolve and the industry continues to iterate, we want to provide an open forum for any firm to self-report their efforts.
