_“As an entrepreneur, if I experience harassment or discrimination, where do I report it and how will I be protected?”_

This question emerged at a founders dinner a few months ago. None of us had a good answer, so, true to form, we started brainstorming. We asked our friends in VC if they had external anti-harassment/ discrimination policies and/or a reporting channel.

In opening the conversation, we learned that the issue was already top of mind for many VCs. But it was hard to see what individual firms were doing from the outside. So #MovingForward was born.


# [](#what-is-mf) What is #MovingForward?

**#MovingForward is an open-source directory that pools diversity, inclusion, and anti-harassment commitments from VCs.**
Supporting VCs have established their commitment to move forward by sharing their current progress in the wake of the discrimination and harassment experiences bravely shared in the past year. Specifically, our supporters have provided:
* Anti-harassment/discrimination policies
* A point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to report harassment and discrimination issues
* A 100-word statement on their work to nurture diverse, inclusive and harassment-free workplaces

This directory is open-source to which any firm can add and update their policies and points of contact. **It is our hope that every major players in venture ecosystem will participate.**


# [](#why-mf) Why #Moving Forward

* **Value for Firms**: VCs say the process of making their policies public and establishing reporting lines has sparked conversations and aligned the firm’s partnership internally around this matter. We hope this movement further motivates that process.
* **Value for Founders**: #MovingForward strives to make it easier for founders to review policies, find supportive investors, and identify a reporting contact. If you don’t see your investors here, share this project with them.

This is a living document, and we value progress, not perfection.

## [](#why-are-we-doing-this)More details, why are you doing this?


A small group of entrepreneurs came together with three goals for this project.

**1. Launch a public, collective step forward for the venture industry.** We aim to highlight the public strategies each firm is committing to so that we can learn and move together.
Crafting an external anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy between the firm and entrepreneurs is just a first step. There’s much more do to, and many organizations are launching far-reaching initiatives to make holistic changes.

**2. Facilitate transparent reporting channels and information routes.** Entrepreneurs facing harassment or discrimination are often unsure where to go to report, causing them to feel like there is no choice except to go public. We face a large issue of under-reporting of issues in our community, because founders don’t know where to go.

One way firms can address this need is by providing a formal point-of-contact for entrepreneurs to feel comfortable sharing incidences of harassment or discrimination. Some VCs are working with third-party organizations that provide HR consulting on templates/policies or reporting channels for people who may need to raise concerns.

We’re also in favor of having an internal point-of-contact contact who can answer questions about the firm’s policy or provide further information on the firm’s diversity, inclusion, and anti-harassment policies.

**3. Provide a universal, open-source, and evolving wiki for continuous updates.** As policies and supporting strategies evolve and the industry continues to iterate, we want to provide an open forum for any firm to self-report their efforts.
